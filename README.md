# TFG Marta de la Rosa
Repository with the files in the Bachelor's Thesis (Trabajo Fin de Grado) of Marta de la Rosa Núñez.

## File description:

- `simulations.ipynb`:   
    An experiment with building the necessary functions in a separate folder to optimize the use of more than one model for the frequency factor. Calls the functions in the `Functions` folder, and outputs a `.csv` with the results in the `Results` folder.

- `Functions/diff_eqs_[].ipynb`:   
    Script with the function to name the differential equations system. The text in brackets `[]` refer to the way the frequency factor depends with temperature.

- `TFG_MARTA.ipynb`:  
    This Jupyter Notebook is the latest version in current development.

- `TFG_MARTA_GCOLAB.ipynb`:  
    This Jupyter Notebook is the latest version in the Google Colab.

- `other_plots.ipynb`:  
    This Jupyter Notebook has some useful plots or calculations for the main code file.

- `LiF_Entropy.ipynb`:  
    This Jupyter Notebook contains an initial study on the expression of the entropy in the Fermi-Dirac statistic for the case of a semiconductor.

- `LiF_Entropy_Conductor.ipynb`:  
    This Jupyter Notebook contains an initial study on the expression of the entropy in the Fermi-Dirac statistic for the case of a conductor.

- `ExperimentalData/ParametrosCineticos.xlsx`:  
    This Excel file contains the kinetic parameters used in the simulations, including trap activation energy and frequency factor for each trap and recombination center.

- `ExperimentalData/ParametrosEstructurales.xlsx`:  
    This Excel file contains the structural parameters used in the simulations, including the total density of available states and trapping probabilities for each trap and recombination center.

- `LaTeX`:  
    This folder contains the latest thesis redaction process.

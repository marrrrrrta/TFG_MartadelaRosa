\section{The mathematical model} \label{sec:modelo}

To describe the thermoluminescent response of a semicoductor, we can use a mathematical model based on the trapping and releasing of charge carriers in the accesible energy levels of the material. 

\vspace{10pt}

Let us first consider the case of an arbitrary semicoductor without impurities. The energy levels of the conduction band and the valence band are separated by a bandgap $E_g$, and can be obtained with Schrodinger's equation that is under the influence of a periodic potential:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:schrodinger}
  \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V(\vec{r}) \right] \psi(\vec{r}) = E ~ \psi(\vec{r}),
\end{equation}

\vspace{10pt}
The periodicity of the potential $V(\vec{r})$ for any lattice vector $\vec{R}$ allows the Bloch's theorem to apply, and so it gives rise to the formation of a band structure, composed by the conduction band, which is typically fully occupied at absolute zero temperature, and the valence band, which is in turn typically empty -or rather, we can consider it filled with holes ($h^+$), or ``positively charged electrons''. The bandgap $E_g$ is then defined as the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band, and for a perfect crystal, no energy states are allowed in that region. This can be clearly seen if we take into account the density of available states, $D(E)$, which is a function of the Fermi-Dirac distribution $f(E)$ for a certain temperature $T$. This function gives the occupancy of any energy level $E$, and can be expressed as:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:fermidirac}
  f(E) = \frac{1}{e^{\frac{E - E_f}{k_B T}} + 1},
\end{equation}

\vspace{10pt}
Where $E_f$ is the Fermi Level, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. If the system is in equilibrium, and we set the case of $T=0K$, the occupancy function $f(E)$ will be equal to 1 for all energy levels below the Fermi level, and 0 for all energy levels above it. This means that the occupancy function will be a step function, with a discontinuity at the Fermi level, and so we can see that there are no available states in the bandgap region.

  \caption{Fermi-Dirac distribution for a semicoductor that is irradiated.}
  \label{fig:FD_irradiation}
\end{figure}


\vspace{10pt}
The introduction of impurities or defects however, break the periodicity of the lattice, and create localized energy levels inside this ``forbidden region''. These levels can be thought of as traps for electrons if we are situated above the fermi level, and traps of holes if we are situated below. When this material is irradiated, electrons from the valence band can be excited to the conduction band, creating an electron-hole pair; and so changing the shape of the occupancy function. Once excited, both electrons and holes get ``trapped'' in these localized energy levels, and the excitation of these pairs into equilibrium will result in the emission of energy. In Figure \ref{fig:FD_irradiation} we can see a broad description of the perturbation of the system from its equilibrium state due to the irradiation, and the return of the system to equilibrium during either thermal stimulation or optical stimulation. If said relaxation processes are radiative, TL and OSL result.

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Images/modeldiagram.pdf}
  \caption{Schematic representation of the theoretical model.}
  \label{fig:TheoreticalModel}
\end{figure}

And so, we can see a schematic representation of our theoretical model in Figure \ref{fig:TheoreticalModel}. Situating the energy in the Y axis, the focus is set in the energy gap of our material. Drawn as a blue or green horizontal line are the energy traps; in blue above the Fermi level there are electron traps, and in green there are hole traps or recombination centers. The vertical arrows describe available transitions; the ones pointing upwards represent an excitation process, and the ones pointing downwards represent a relaxation process. 

\vspace{10pt}

Mathematically, we can describe these processes with a set of differential equations that take into account the rate of change of the number of electrons and holes in the bands and traps. This set will depend on the properties of the material, and the luminescence response we are trying to model. For an arbitrary system, we can write the following set of equations that describe the rate of change of the number of electrons and holes in the conduction band $n_c$, the valence band $n_v$:
\vspace{10pt}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:dn_cdt}
  \frac{dn_c}{dt} = \textcolor{orange}{G} - \textcolor{customblue}{\left[\sum_i \frac{dn_i}{dt}\right]} \cdot n_c - \textcolor{customgreen}{\left[ \sum_{j=R, N\!R}\, ^iA_{mn} \cdot m_j \right]} \cdot n_c
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:dn_idt}
  \textcolor{customblue}{\frac{dn_i}{dt} = -p_i \cdot n_i + A_i \cdot [N_i - n_i]}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:dm_jdt}
  \textcolor{customgreen}{\frac{dm_j}{dt} = -^hp_j \cdot m_j + A_j \cdot [M_j - m_j]} \cdot n_v - \textcolor{customgreen}{^iA_{mn} \cdot m_j} \cdot n_c
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:dn_vdt}
  \frac{dn_v}{dt} = \textcolor{orange}{G} - \textcolor{customgreen}{\sum_{j=R, N\!R} \left[-^hp_j \cdot m_j + A_j \cdot [M_j - mj] \textcolor{black}{~ \cdot ~n_v}\right]} 
\end{equation}

\vspace{15pt}
Where every term is defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.2cm,parsep=0cm]
  \item $G$: electron-hole pairs generated by the radiation [cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$]
  \item $n_c$: electron concentration in the conduction band [cm$^{-3}$]
  \item $n_v$: electron concentration in the valence band [cm$^{-3}$]
  \item $n_i$: electron concentration in trap i [cm$^{-3}$]
  \item $m_j$: hole concentration in the recombination center j [cm$^{-3}$]
  \item $N_i$: total density of electron trapping centres in trap i [cm$^{-3}$]
  \item $M_j$: total density of recombination centers [cm$^{-3}$]
  \item $p_i$: electron release probability factor for trap i [s$^{-1}$]
  \item $^hp_j$: hole release probability factor for recombination center j [s$^{-1}$]
  \item $A_i$: electron trapping probability factor for trap i [cm$^{3}$ s$^{-1}$]
  \item $^iA_{mn}$: recombination probability factor for recombination center j [cm$^{3}$ s$^{-1}$]
\end{itemize}

\vspace{10pt}

Equation \ref{eq:dn_cdt} describes the change rate of electron concentrations in the conduction band. To interpret this equation, we can see that to the electron-hole pairs generated by the radiation ($G$), there are two terms substracted. The first one correlates to the electrons that leave the continuum levels of the conduction band and get trapped in the discrete levels of the material ---a process described by \ref{eq:dn_idt}, that will have a further discussion in section \ref{sec:factorfrecuencia}---, and the second one answers to the electrons in the conduction band that recombine with holes with a radiative ($R$) or non-radiative ($N\!R$) process. It is easy to see that this second term corresponds to the third term of \ref{eq:dm_jdt}. 

\vspace{10pt}
The change rate of electron concentrations in the valence band is shown in \ref{eq:dn_vdt}, and it follows a similar logic. This time however, we only take into account the terms multiplied by the electron density in the valence band ($n_v$) seen in equation \ref{eq:dm_jdt}; one that represents the holes leaving the continuum to get trapped in the recombination centers, and another that accounts for the addition of electrons that are released from the recombination centers and recombine with the holes in the valence band. The terms described correspond to Equations \ref{eq:dn_idt} and \ref{eq:dm_jdt} describe the total change rate of electrons and holes in the discrete levels of the material. The signs of the terms in these equations follow the convention that we are set in the conduction band, and so any electron that leaves the conduction band is represented with a negative term, and any electron that enters is represented with a positive term.

\vspace{10pt}

To carry out a numerical simulation of the process, we will need to solve the set of differential equations \ref{eq:dn_cdt} -- \ref{eq:dn_vdt} using RKF-45 method, which is a Runge-Kutta method of order 4 and 5. This method will obtain the charge concentration in all traps and recombination centers at an instant of time. The solving of this set of equations will be done for the three phases required to obtain the TL glow curve. To do this, the intrinsic and kinetic parameters are kept constant, varying the external conditions of the system such as temperature and electron-hole pair generation rate. 

\vspace{10pt}
The first phase is \textit{irradiation}, where the material is exposed to ionizing radiation. It begins with all levels initially empty [$n_c(0) = n_v(0) = n_i(0) = m_j(0) = 0$], and the electron-hole pairs generated as a result will have a constant value as a function of time ($G = 1000$ cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$). The temperature is set to a constant $T = 25$ \textdegree C and the filling process takes one hour (3600 seconds). The second phase is \textit{relaxation}, where the material is left undisturbed at a constant temperature for a defined period of time. Taking as initial values the final values of the irradiation phase, the temperature is kept constant at $T = 25$ \textdegree C, and the electron-hole pairs generation rate is set to $G = 0$ cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$. The relaxation process is set for one week (604,800 seconds). Finally, the third phase is \textit{heating}, where the material is taken from an initial temperature $T_0$ to a final temperature at a constant linear heating rate. The numerical resolution of the set equations is similar to the previous phases, but now with the temperature varying linearly with the expression:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:heating}
  T(t) = T_0 + \beta \cdot t
\end{equation}

\vspace{7pt}
Where the heating rate is set to $\beta = 1 $ \textdegree C s$^{-1}$. The electron-hole pairs generation rate is set to $G = 0$ cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$, and the charge concentration values are taken from the final values of the relaxation phase. The heating process is set to last 400 seconds. The results after the numerical resolution of the set of equations will be the charge concentration values for every instant of time throughout the whole heating cycle [$n_c(t), n_v(t), n_i(t), m_j(t)$]. It is in this phase when the luminescent emission occurs, and so the intensity of the emmited light can be estimated in relation to the radiative recombination of electron-hole pairs. We can give the expression for the intensity of the emitted light as it follows:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:intensity}
  I(t) = -\frac{dm}{dt} \approx {}^RA_{mn} \cdot m_R \cdot n_c
\end{equation}

\vspace{7pt}
Representing this intensity as a function of time will be the objective of the simulations, as it is the key to understand the thermoluminescent response of the $LiF:M\!g,Ti$ after being irradiated.

\section{The frequency factor} \label{sec:factorfrecuencia}

As introduced in Section \ref{sec:modelo}, there is a greater discussion to be had about the releasing probability of electrons and holes, as it determines in great part the electron-hole pairs available to recombine. If we consider that after being irradiated, the material will release its carriers through \textit{thermal excitation}, an electron trapped in a lattice defect with energy $E_t$ and temperature $T$ will have a probability of being released that follows Arrhenius equation. The probability per second that the electron will be thermally excited into the conduction band is given by:

\begin{equation}
  p = s \cdot e^{-\frac{E_t}{k_B T}}
\end{equation}

\vspace{10pt}
Where $s$ is known as the \textit{frequency factor}. It can be interpreted as the ``attempt to escape'' frequency, as it is a measure of the number of times per second that energy is absorbed from phonons in the lattice. The exponential that follows is the probability that the energy absorbed is enough to cause a transition from the localized state to the conduction band. 

\vspace{10pt}

The frequency factor is a very important parameter in the study of thermoluminescence, as it determines the rate at which electrons are released from traps. It is a function of the material properties, as shown in its definition:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:freqfactor}
  s = \nu_{ph} \cdot K \cdot e^{\frac{\Delta S}{k_B}}
\end{equation}

\vspace{10pt}
Where $\nu_{ph}$ is the lattice phonon vibration frequency and $K$ is the transition probability constant. Typically, one can expect $s \sim 10^{12} -10^{14}$ s$^{-1}$, which is consistent with the values of $\nu$ for most solids. The term $e^{\nicefrac{\Delta S}{k_B}}$ is a correction factor that accounts for the entropy change associated with the transition from the localized state to the conduction band. 

\vspace{10pt}

From equation \ref{eq:freqfactor} we see that the frequency factor has an exponential dependency with the entropy change. This, taking the Quantum Statistical Mechanics theory \cite{brey}, does not align with the invariance of said factor with temperature, as entropy, with its own definition, should vary when temperature does. While a rigorous proof of the overall temperature dependence of the frequency factor is beyond the scope of this work, one model is proposed to provide an approximate perspective on how this dependency could influence the resulting TL glow curve. 

\vspace{10pt}

At first glance, the simplest model was considered, where the entropy would be linear with the temperature ($\Delta S \propto T$). This theory was quickly discarded as would make the entropy factor increase exponentially with the temperature ($s \propto e^T$), and so the probability of excitation would tend to infinity in a very short range of temperature increase.

\vspace{10pt}

To solve this issue, a more refined model was considered, where the entropy would now be logarithmically dependent on the temperature ($\Delta S \propto \ln(T)$). The constant of the proportionality could be called $\alpha$, and so the resulting expression of the frequency factor can be written as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:freqfactor_lnT}
    s = \nu_{ph} \cdot K \cdot T^{\nicefrac{\alpha}{k_B}}
\end{equation}

\vspace{10pt}

It is clear now that a softer dependency with the temperature is achieved, and the previous problem of the entropy factor tending to infinity is solved. The value of $\alpha$ can be adjusted to keep the entropy contribution at a realistic magnitude ---typically we have $\Delta S \sim  1\!-\!3 ~~k_B$ over the glow curve temperature range---. For that reason, we have selected a value of:

\begin{equation}
    \alpha = \frac{1.5 ~k_B}{ln(300)} \approx 0.26 ~k_B
\end{equation}

\vspace{10pt}

This choice ensures that the frequency factor remains within a reasonable range across the temperature spectrum of interest, and yields TL glow curves that are consistent with experimental observations of LiF:Mg,Ti materials.


\section{About LiF:Mg,Ti} \label{sec:LiF}


Lithium fluoride (LiF) is a crystalline material that has been widely used in radiation dosimetry due to its favorable % !!!!
properties. It first appeared as a thermoluminescent dosimetry material in the 1950's, and since then, it has been extensively studied in the field of radiation detection. The material is composed of lithium (Li) and fluor (F) %?????
atoms, forming a crystal lattice structure of a face-centered cubic (FCC) type. Without any impurities, LiF is a semiconductor, with a bandgap of approximately 14 eV, which makes it an excellent insulator at room temperature.

\vspace{10pt}

To enhance the properties for radiation detection, LiF is often doped with magnesium (Mg) and titanium (Ti) ions, and sold commercially as TLD-100 \cite{lif}. The doping process introduces defects in the crystal lattice, creating energy levels within the bandgap. These defects play a crucial role in trapping and releasing charge carriers, which are responsible for the thermoluminescent response of the material. This process is known as thermoluminescence (TL), where the trapped electrons are released upon heating, resulting in the emission of light. The intensity of this emitted light is proportional to the amount of radiation absorbed by the material, making it a valuable tool for dosimetry.


\vspace{10pt}

The TL response of LiF:Mg,Ti is characterized by a glow curve, which is a plot of the intensity of emitted light as a function of temperature. The glow curve typically exhibits several peaks, each corresponding to different trapping levels in the material. The position and shape of these peaks can provide valuable information about the trapping and recombination processes occurring in the material, and they are key to understanding the thermoluminescent response of LiF:Mg,Ti.

\section{Analysis of the TL glow curve} \label{sec:theoryTLcurves}

The TL glow curve is a plot of the intensity of light emitted by a thermoluminescent material as a function of temperature or time. The shape and characteristics of the this curve can provide valuable information about the trapping and recombination processes occurring in the material, and it is a key tool for understanding the thermoluminescent response of LiF:Mg, Ti. 

\vspace{10pt}

The glow curve typically consists of one or more peaks, each corresponding to a specific trapping level in the material. The position of the peak on the temperature axis indicates the energy required to release the trapped electrons, while the area under the peak is proportional to the number of trapped electrons. 
The shape of the glow curve can be influenced by various factors, including the heating rate, the dose of radiation absorbed, and the presence of impurities or defects in the material, and so it is important to choose them carefully to obtain reliable results.% ??

\vspace{10pt}

There are several methods for analyzing the glow curve, and they may be caregorized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Partial-peak methods}: They focus on analyzing a limited portion of the glow curve peak, generally the ``initial rise'' edge. They are relatively simple, and generally sensitive to noise as they do not take into account the whole peak.
  \item \textbf{Whole-peak methods}: They use the entire glow peak to estimate the trap parameters. They are more robust than partial-peak methods, but they can be more complex to implement.
  \item \textbf{Peak-shape methods}: They use the geometry of the glow curve peak ---generally using the peak maximum and half-maximum points--- to estimate the trap paramenters. They are quick and convenient, but for the case of complex glow curves, they can be less accurate.
  \item \textbf{Peak-position methods}: They relate the position of the glow peak maximum to the heating rate or dose applied to extract kinetic parameters. They are useful for tracking shifts due to changing experimental conditions, but again, they can be imprecise when dealing with overlapping peaks.
  \item \textbf{Curve-fitting methods}: They fit the entire glow curve using a sum of theoretical peak models ---generally using the first-order kinetics model--- to extract the trap parameters. They are very accurate, but they can be computationally expensive and require a good initial guess for the parameters.
  \item \textbf{Isothermal methods}: In these methods, the sample is held at a constant temperature and the TL intensity is measured as a function of time. They provide direct access to kinetic parameters without the influence of the heating rate, but require so precise thermal control that are less commonly used.
\end{itemize}

In our case, we will use the Curve-fitting method, as it is (\textbf{razón????})
